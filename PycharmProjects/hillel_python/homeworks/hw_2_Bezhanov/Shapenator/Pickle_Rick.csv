1291,1674,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Rick?
1292,1675,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Morty!
1293,1676,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Rick?
1294,1677,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hey, Mooorty!"
1295,1678,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?"
1296,1679,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!"
1297,1680,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Morty?
1298,1681,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Rick? W-where are you?
1299,1682,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"On my work bench, Morty."
1300,1683,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?"
1301,1684,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Flip the pickle over.
1302,1685,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something."
1303,1686,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge."
1304,1688,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,And?
1305,1689,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"""And""? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?"
1306,1690,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Was it?
1307,1691,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before"
1308,1692,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?"
1309,1693,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner."
1310,1694,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Well, can you move? Can you fly?"
1311,1695,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.
1312,1696,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"All right, well, do pickles live forever or --"
1313,1697,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle."
1314,1698,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.
1315,1699,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't."
1316,1700,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa?"
1317,1701,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle!"
1318,1702,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go."
1319,1703,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Where are you guys going?
1320,1704,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you."
1321,1705,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez."
1322,1706,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?"
1323,1707,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Morty!
1324,1708,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact.Morty, I assure you, I would never ""find a way"" to ""get out of"" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes."
1325,1709,3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?
1326,1710,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go."
1327,1711,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?"
1328,1712,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?"
1329,1713,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation."
1330,1714,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late."
1331,1715,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?"
1332,1716,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help?"
1333,1717,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Can't argue with that.
1334,1718,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Great. We'll see you later.
1335,1719,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  Oh, great. Stupid cat."
1336,1720,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!"
1337,1721,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
1338,1722,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, crap, that sun is bright."
1339,1723,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet."
1340,1724,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die.
1341,1725,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, God, moisture."
1342,1726,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here!"
1343,1727,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Oh! Oh!
1344,1728,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular!"
1345,1729,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, shiiit! Oh! Oh! Oh!"
1346,1730,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Come on. That's it.
1347,1731,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Come get this delicious brine.
1348,1732,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on!"
1349,1733,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Yes!
1350,1734,3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?
1351,1735,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?"
1352,1736,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class."
1353,1738,3,3,Pickle Rick,Mr. Goldenfold,"Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. You're patients of Dr. Wong, too?"
1354,1739,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Temporarily. By order of the school.
1355,1740,3,3,Pickle Rick,Mr. Goldenfold,Me too. How long have you all been eating poop?
1356,1741,3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,We... have never... eaten poop.
1357,1742,3,3,Pickle Rick,Mr. Goldenfold,"Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to?"
1358,1743,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong. Come on in."
1359,1744,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?
1360,1745,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --"
1361,1746,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,He turned himself into a pickle.
1362,1747,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here."
1363,1748,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?
1364,1749,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"What? No, what kind of question is that?"
1365,1750,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
1366,1751,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which..."
1367,1752,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?"
1368,1753,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Wow. Ugh.
1369,1760,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important."
1370,1761,3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.
1371,1762,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, he did not!"
1372,1763,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe.
1373,1764,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Do you really not see what's happening here?
1374,1765,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Tell me.
1375,1766,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy."
1376,1767,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings."
1377,1768,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Fuck you.
1378,1770,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Fuck both of you, too."
1379,1771,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special."
1380,1773,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"God damn it, I love myself."
1381,1774,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Pickle Riiick!
1382,1775,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Get that parkour. Get that parkour!
1383,1776,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit."
1384,1777,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out."
1385,1778,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
1386,1779,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,What is it?
1387,1782,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Where is it?
1388,1784,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?"
1389,1787,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Put him on, and locate the phone he's using."
1390,1788,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out."
1391,1789,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Your mere presence in this building violates international law.
1392,1791,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,You should know those men killed themselves.
1393,1792,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,And how is that?
1394,1793,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,They didn't  let me out.
1395,1795,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children!"
1396,1796,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Uh, is this not a good time or...?"
1397,1797,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Some of my men are calling you ""Solen'ya"""
1398,1798,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,That'd be a lucky break for you.
1399,1801,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Ah.
1400,1803,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,...because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents.
1401,1805,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,He's just a pickle!
1402,1807,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,He's not the only one.
1403,1810,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Then Katarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar."
1404,1812,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?"
1405,1813,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.
1406,1815,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.
1407,1816,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.
1408,1818,3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,I never said I was angry at you.
1409,1819,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say ""I'm angry at mommy"" out loud."
1410,1820,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Oh, my God!"
1411,1822,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him --"
1412,1823,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone."
1413,1824,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,You admire him for that.
1414,1825,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,It's better than making your problems other people's problems.
1415,1826,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, come on!"
1416,1828,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,You should know that isn't original.
1417,1830,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,There's nothing I won't do to see her again.
1418,1831,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit."
1419,1833,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences."
1420,1835,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Jaguar couldn't make it.
1421,1836,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. I'm unsealing the building."
1422,1837,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"No, thanks. I'm coming for you now."
1423,1838,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Pickle Man, there's $100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. I'll give you the combination."
1424,1840,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! Do we have a deal?!"
1425,1841,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you."
1426,1842,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Jaguar's daughter is dead.
1427,1843,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Huh, so you're a liar."
1428,1844,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Jaguar was an animal. You're an intelligent pickle. We can do business.
1429,1845,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,I don't think so. See you soon.
1430,1846,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Is the helicopter here?
1431,1848,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Tell them we were robbed.
1432,1850,3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Farewell, Solen'ya."
1433,1852,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live."
1434,1854,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants."
1435,1856,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh!"
1436,1857,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.
1437,1858,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Good. Summer, you go."
1438,1859,3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.
1439,1860,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Good job. Morty, do you have an ""I"" statement?"
1440,1861,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.
1441,1862,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week?
1442,1863,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Ugh.
1443,1864,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,You must be Rick.
1444,1865,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Mm-hmm.
1445,1866,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,I've heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. You're a lucky fella.
1446,1867,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse?"
1447,1868,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Dad I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe.
1448,1869,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent."
1449,1870,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,By changing you from a pickle to a human.
1450,1871,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Yes.
1451,1872,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?"
1452,1873,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,So I wouldn't have to come here.
1453,1874,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Why didn't you want to come here?
1454,1875,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked."
1455,1876,3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose."
1456,1877,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you."
1457,1878,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be."
1458,1879,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever..."
1459,1880,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it."
1460,1881,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist."
1461,1882,3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,Are we gonna go back?
1462,1883,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now?"
1463,1884,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony."
1464,1885,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Eh.
1465,1886,3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man."
1466,1887,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Weird breed.
1467,1888,3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach."
1468,1890,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on."
1469,1891,3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,Absolutely.
1470,1892,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"I, I liked her."
1471,1893,3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?"
1472,1894,3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"Yeah, either one. Either one."
1473,1895,3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"You'll never get away with this, Concerto."
1474,1897,3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god."
1475,1898,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!"
1476,1900,3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,Jaguar!
1477,1901,3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Who? Who was that, Rick?"
1478,1902,3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy."
